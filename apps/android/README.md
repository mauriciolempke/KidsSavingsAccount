## Implementation Timeline
ðŸš§ **Deferred** - To be implemented after web app is stable and `react-core` package is extracted.

## Next Steps
1. Complete web app implementation
2. Extract shared logic to `react-core`
3. Set up React Native project structure
4. Adapt UI components for native
5. Implement platform-specific storage layer
6. Test Material Design compliance
